# Network-Packet-Analysis-and-SQL-Injection-Detection
Project Structure and Key Components

1. Python Scripts

analyze_pcap.py:   This script performs an in-depth PCAP (packet capture) file analysis. It extracts key information from network packets, identifies potential security threats, and provides actionable insights for network forensics.
edit_packet.py:    A powerful tool for modifying and customizing network packets. It allows users to manipulate packet headers and payloads, enabling the creation of test scenarios for security analysis.
edit_python.py:    This script facilitates automated editing of Python files, possibly for dynamic script generation or template-based scripting. It enhances flexibility and speeds up the development of custom scripts.
new_script.py:     A newly introduced module, potentially adding novel functionalities or enhancing existing capabilities. Its inclusion highlights the continuous development and expansion of the project.
packet_create.py:  This script enables the creation and simulation of network packets from scratch. It allows for the generation of customized packet traffic for testing intrusion detection and network security tools.
train_model.py:    The core machine learning component, this script trains a model to detect SQL injection attacks. It processes labelled network traffic data to build a predictive model that can identify and classify potential SQL injection threats in live network traffic.

2. Data Files

edited_test_with_sql.pcap: A PCAP file containing modified network traffic, likely used for testing the SQL injection detection model. It showcases how SQL injections can be embedded in network traffic.
test1file.pcap: A raw network traffic file that serves as a dataset for testing and validation of packet analysis and SQL injection detection functionalities.
test_with_sql.pcap: A network capture file with SQL injection traffic. This file is essential for training and testing the machine learning model's ability to recognize SQL injection attempts in real-world scenarios.
sql_injection_model.pkl: The trained machine learning model for SQL injection detection. It serves as the final output of the model training process and is ready for deployment in intrusion detection systems (IDS).
SQL_injection_report.csv: A comprehensive analysis report summarizing the results of the SQL injection detection process. It provides detailed insights into the trained model's detection accuracy, misclassifications, and performance metrics.

Why This Project Stands Out

This project is a unique blend of network security, machine learning, and automation. It goes beyond basic packet analysis by incorporating packet editing, custom traffic generation, and advanced threat detection using a machine learning model. Using real-world datasets (PCAP files) for training and testing adds authenticity and relevance. Furthermore, the inclusion of a SQL injection detection model highlights its focus on cybersecurity, a critical area in modern-day network defence. This project showcases expertise in network forensics, machine learning, and security analysis, making it a valuable addition to any portfolio.
